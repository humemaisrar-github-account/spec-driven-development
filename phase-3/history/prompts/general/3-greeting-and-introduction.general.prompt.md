## Prompt

--title "Greeting and Introduction" --stage general

## Response snapshot

Provided a warm greeting and outlined my capabilities as a Claude Code assistant, including automatic PHR recording, ADR suggestions, and support for the spec→plan→tasks workflow. Also confirmed readiness to implement Phase II Todo Web Application.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established working relationship and confirmed understanding of project context. Verified existing project structure with specs, backend, and frontend components already created for Todo Web App.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: none
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Initial greeting exchanged. Project structure appears to be in advanced state with many files already created. Need to verify completion status of tasks.
